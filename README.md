# Python-Basics 🐍

A beginner-friendly collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed to teach core Python concepts through hands‑on examples.

## 🧭 Overview

This repository helps you learn and practice essential Python programming topics, making it ideal for those starting their journey in Python and data science.

## 📂 What's Inside

- **Jupyter Notebooks** covering:
  - Variables, data types, and basic I/O
  - Control flow (`if`, `for`, `while` loops)
  - Functions, modules, and exception handling
  - Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, methods, inheritance
  - Practical examples and exercises

- **Python scripts** (.py files) that reinforce core concepts through runnable examples.
- **Commented code**: each example includes explanations to help you understand the "why" behind the code.

## 🛠️ Who Is This For?

- Python beginners eager to build a strong foundation
- Students or self‑learners prepping for data science or software development
- Anyone wanting to explore Python scripting and OOP basics :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/agarwaljubin/Pyhton-Basics.git
    cd Pyhton-Basics
    ```

2. **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If no requirements file is present, the notebooks rely only on standard Python libraries; you can add libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, etc., if needed.)*

4. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Explore files in the `notebooks/` folder and run the cells interactively.

## 🎯 Learning Path

Start with basic scripts and move into the notebooks for deeper learning. You’ll build knowledge progressively:

1. **Basics**: syntax, control flow, data types  
2. **Intermediate**: functions, error handling, file I/O  
3. **OOP**: design classes, work with objects and inheritance  
4. **Practice**: implement exercises, extend examples
